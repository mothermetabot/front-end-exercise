# Front-End Developer Exercises #

We're constantly on the lookout for talented front-end developers to join our teams. Not only does that mean we're looking for a solid understanding of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript language, but also their practical application with respect to how browsers work today.

Please read all the document before start the exercises.

### Overview ###

To complete these exercises you will need Git installed on your computer and a GitHub account. If you don't have one already, please go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for your free account. You will also need a working development environment, including a code editor of your choice.

You may use any open source libraries as you see fit. Use discretion when using external libraries or tools to complete the exercise. We are interested in your practical knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, not your ability to use plugins, frameworks or libraries.

You will be using Git for source control.

Following the completion of the application, you'll answer a few questions about the work you just completed. Please allow approximately 3 hours for this exercise. It should take you about 2 hours to complete the programming exercise and another hour to answer the follow up questions.

When you are done the exercise, commit all your work in GitHub and push it up to your GitHub fork. You'll be required to send an email with the link to your work immediately after completion.

Do not create a pull request or try to merge into the exercises repository.

### Setup ###

Follow the points listed below to create a minimal development environment and begin with the exercises.

* Download and install Git on your computer and initialize with your GitHub account.
* Download and install any IDE and tools of your choice.
* Fork and clone the [Front End Developer Exercises](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui) repository.

The initial project includes a recommended files and directories structure. You can change, add or remove files and directories if you think it will be useful to you.

* [assets](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui/tree/master/assets)
    * [common](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui/tree/master/assets/common)
        * [css](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui/tree/master/assets/common/css)
            * [main.css](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui/tree/master/assets/common/css/main.css) Main CSS file.
        * [fonts](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui/tree/master/assets/common/fonts)
        * [images](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui/tree/master/assets/common/images)
        * [js](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui/tree/master/assets/common/js)
            * [main.js](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui/tree/master/assets/common/js/main.js) Main JS file.
    * [lib](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui/tree/master/assets/lib)
* [index.html](https://github.com/estebanspina/dev-exercises-ui/blob/master/index.html) Main HTML file.

Some of the directories listed above do not exist in the initial structure because they do not contain any file. If you need any of these, simply create and commit it into your fork.

### Main Tasks ###

Create a HTML, CSS and JavaScript navigation menu that includes:

* Five main tabs (main, about us, services, blog and contact us).
* The services tab must have a drop down submenu.
* Add at least three social networks icons and point them to their corresponding website.
* The menu must work in the following breakpoint:
    * From 320px (mobile).
    * From 1024px (tablet).
    * From 1366px (desktop) and above.

### Secondary Or Bonus Task ###

This is an optional task and will be taken as a bonus.

Modify your application to take the menu, social configuration and other contents from a JSON file.

### Questions ###

Please answer each of the following questions within the README.md file of your fork (and be sure to commit all the required files). You only need a couple lines per answer, and point form answers are fine.

Q: Which browser would you prefer we test this in ?

A: I would prefer we test this in the most widely used browser, which seems to be Google Chrome according to the following wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers
However, ideally it would be best to test this webpage in as many different browsers as possible, to ensure universal compatibility.

Q: How long did you work on this programming exercise for ?

A: I worked on this project for about 2-3 hours.

Q: What websites did you use to help you complete this exercise (please provide links) ?

A: I utilized the following websites: 
	https://www.w3schools.com - to help me get started in terms of building up the HTML structure
	https://fontawesome.com -  for high quality icons
	www.stackoverflow.com - for generic javascript and css questions

Q: If you had more time, how would you improve your implementation ?

A: I would probably try to make my project look more visually appealing (design & colors).

Q: Anything else you'd like us to know ?

A: I think this was a very interesting test, as it helped me to implement a navbar without utilizing a built-in plugin.
