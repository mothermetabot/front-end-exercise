### Setup

The initial project includes a recommended files and directories structure. You can change, add or remove files and directories if you think it will be useful to you.

-   assets
    -   common
        -   css
            -   main.css
            -   main.js
-   index.html

You are allowed to use any frameworks/libraries you see fit.

### Main Tasks

 1. Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript and/or Typescript to create a navigation menu that includes:
-   Five main tabs ("Home", "Services", "Pricing", "Contact" and "About Us", only "Home" must be functional).
- 	The "Home" page should contain a heading and some text (you can use ipsum lorem for this purpose)
-   The services tab must have a drop down submenu with 2 options ("Analysis" and "Testing")
-   The menu must work in the following formats:
    -   From 320px (mobile).
    -   From 1024px (tablet).
    -   From 1366px (desktop) and above.

2. While the page is loading make an API call to your favorite REST API and display the data in the "Home" page. Example API:
	- https://http.cat/
- Create a simple way of testing the API call in your application without having to load the page.

### Bonus task
- Add a graph/plot to the "Home" page that shows some kind of data. Use any dependencies you deem necessary.
